# Introduction
Introduce *yourself*. What's your background? Could you code before Data School? What did your 
daily work pattern look like before Data School? Etc. This section will be placed in 
an introductory block at the top of the page separate from the rest of the content. Don't change the section title from "Introduction" otherwise this process won't work correctly.

# My Project
Rather than yourself, this is the space to introduce your **project**. What are 
your goals, what is your data, how do you plan to work with it? Perhaps show some example data if 
it would help.

In order to build this demo poster correctly, you will also need to have installed the `tidyverse`, 
`gapminder`, and `kableExtra` packages.

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.


```{r}

beauties2017 <- read_csv('data/beauties2017.csv') #loading your data file
head(beauties2017)

# determine mean of reps

beauties_summary <- beauties2017 %>% 
  select(entry, 10:18) %>% 
  group_by(entry) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE) # remove NA to estimate mean of reps 

beauties_raw <- beauties2017 %>% 
  select(-c(10:18), -REP, -row, -range) %>% 
  left_join(beauties_summary, by="entry") %>% 
  distinct()

```

**Tables**

```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(beauties_summary, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "Example of data measured for each trait") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")

```

```{r plot1, fig.cap="First"}

#gather and spread
#tidy is a rectangular data - 2 dimensions i.e. rows and columns
#if, say, traits names are column names - wide format data - as you add
#new variable, the data becomes wider
#long format is in its simplicity a pair-wise data
#for your data you will have 72x9 number of rows
#spread makes data wider
#gather makes data long

#functions - anything that follows () is a function ##generalisation - CAREFUL

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Do you expect that everything will be able 
to be completed within R, or will you need to work with multiple tools to get the right result?
Which of the digital skills needed for your project have you learned since starting Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here. What about this tool makes it your favourite?

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

What parts of your project take the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

This summary is mostly about your project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? Have you
tried applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!
